How to Build the Project:
This project contains a make file that can be used to both build and run the project. Don't worry the makefile is not THE way to run the project, but 'make run' is more convienent than './bin/{fileName}.out'. Check the section bellow for how to use the makefile.

Relavent Options for the makefile:
make       - The default option, both builds and runs the project
make build - Builds the project
make run   - Runs the project

*Note: all binaries are stored in the 'bin' subdirectory by default. This can be changed by changing the 'binDir' variable.
